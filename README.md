# Hey there, I'm Adhit

I'm currently exploring NLP and Vision domains, with a growing interest in reading and understanding research papers. Alongside this, I'm learning GPU programming to use high-performance computing for advanced AI workloads.

I love learning from the community and look forward to actively contributing to meaningful projects.

I'm currently working on a semantic-search based CLI tool for images.


## Fun Fact

Outside of Building intresting projects and reading papers, I enjoy taking photographs, playing with dogs, and gaming.  
I'm currently exploring the lands between in Elden Ring.
